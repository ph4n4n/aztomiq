# 🚀 Release Notes - AZtomiq v1.0.0 "Initial Atomic"

Welcome to the first official release of **AZtomiq**! This is more than just an update; it is a complete rebirth (rebranding & refactoring) from the legacy ZTools project into a true **Modern Multi-tool Framework**.

---

## 🌟 What's New in v1.0.0?

### ⚛️ "Atomic" Feature Architecture

We are introducing a completely new design philosophy. Every tool (feature) is now a self-operating "Atom" located in `src/features/`.

- **Self-contained**: Code, styles, logic, and translations for a tool are bundled within a single folder.
- **Easily Scalable**: You can add or remove a tool simply by manipulating its directory without ever touching the system core.

### 🛠️ Powerful `aztomiq` CLI

Development has never been easier with our new CLI suite:

- `tool:create`: Automatically scaffold the boilerplate for a new tool in just 1 second.
- `status`: Scans the entire ecosystem to report on localization and configuration health.
- `analyze`: Monitor the payload size (JS/CSS) of every tool to maintain peak performance.

### 🌍 Production-Ready i18n

The multi-language system has been redesigned for unlimited scaling:

- **Atomic Locales**: Automatically merges translations from individual features into the global table.
- **Native Support**: English and Vietnamese are deeply integrated, making the project ready for global users from day one.

### 🎨 Modern Design System

The UI has been upgraded to a premium **Glassmorphism-inspired** aesthetic:

- Full migration to **Lucide Icons** for a consistent visual language.
- Smooth Dark Mode transitions with elegant backdrop blur effects.
- 100% responsive across all devices, starting from 320px width.

### 📚 Comprehensive Documentation

We believe that great documentation is the soul of Open Source:

- The `docs/` folder contains detailed guides on structure, deployment, and development practices.
- An upgraded `README.md` with full installation info and project philosophy.
