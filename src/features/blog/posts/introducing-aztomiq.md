# ⚛️ AZtomiq: A New Era of Web Utilities

Welcome to **AZtomiq**, a modern, high-performance, open-source multi-tool framework designed with a **Privacy-first** philosophy and built for speed.

## 🌟 Why AZtomiq?

In a web landscape dominated by heavy and bloated frameworks, AZtomiq takes a different path: **The purity of Vanilla JS and the power of Atomic Architecture.**

We believe that utility tools - whether they are for financial calculations, text processing, or developer utilities - should be:

1. **Fast**: Instant load times, immediate feedback.
2. **Private**: 100% Client-side processing. Your data stays in your browser.
3. **Modular**: Every tool is a self-contained entity, easy to maintain and scale.

## 🏗️ Atomic Architecture

In AZtomiq, every tool is an "Atom". A typical feature folder includes:

- `tool.yaml`: The configuration brain.
- `index.ejs`: The UI skeleton.
- `script.js` & `style.css`: The muscles and appearance.
- `locales/`: The multi-lingual voice.

This approach allows developers to scaffold a new tool in seconds:

```bash
npm run aztomiq tool:create [tool-name]
```

## 🛡️ Privacy is Priority #1

Unlike traditional online services that send your data to a server for processing, AZtomiq leverages the power of modern browsers. When you calculate payroll or format a massive JSON file, that data **never leaves your device**.

## 🚀 The Future of AZtomiq

We are constantly evolving the ecosystem with:

- **Smart Caching** for a seamless PWA experience.
- A consistent **Design System** (Glassmorphism inspired).
- Advanced user modes (Standard & Advanced).

Join us in building a faster, safer, and more convenient web!
